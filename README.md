### 1. Project Overview

The project is an end-to-end application designed to transform the way sales and shipping data are managed and analyzed. It provides a complete solution that caters to both customer-facing operations and back-end business analytics. By integrating robust database design, data transformation (ETL), and interactive user interfaces, the system improves order tracking, feedback collection, and strategic decision-making.

### 2. Motivation & Data Sources

Recognizing the critical role of customer feedback and the need for operational transparency in e-commerce, the project was initiated to empower businessesâ€”especially those without their own shipment service. The data is primarily sourced from an e-commerce sales dataset on Kaggle, supplemented by additional synthetic data from Mockaroo (for names, addresses, etc.) and cross-checked using ChatGPT. This mix of sources ensures that both real and simulated data contribute to a robust, practical solution.

### 3. Application Design and Technologies

The application is built using a mix of modern tools and technologies:

- **Python** serves as the core programming language.
- **MySQL Workbench** is used for sophisticated database design and ERD modeling.
- **PyQt Designer** enables the creation of intuitive and interactive user interfaces.
- Additional libraries such as **Pandas, Sklearn, and PyQt5** further enhance data handling, machine learning capabilities, and UI design.

This technology stack ensures that the system is both scalable and user-friendly.

### 4. Database Architecture & ETL Process

The project employs a dual-database strategy:

- **Operational Database:**
    
    This relational database is designed to handle day-to-day transactions and store the latest 30 days of data. It follows a normalized schema that captures details such as order information, customer data, product details, staff interactions, and shipping updates.
    
- **Analytical Database:**
    
    For historical analysis, data is archived for the past three months in a star schema format. The central fact table (sales_fact_table) connects with various dimension tables (product_dimension, date_dimension, location_dimension, and fulfilment_dimension), enabling efficient slicing, dicing, and drill-down operations for in-depth analysis.
    

The ETL process is implemented using Python and SQL. Data is extracted from the operational database, transformed to ensure quality and consistency, and then loaded into the analytical database. This ensures that the analytics module always has access to clean, up-to-date historical data for strategic insights.

### 5. Operational Module

This module is focused on enhancing the customer and staff experience in real-time:

- **Customer Interface:**
    - **User Authentication:** Customers can create new accounts or log in using existing credentials. Passwords are securely hashed (using the argon2 hasher) for enhanced security.
    - **Order Tracking:** Customers can view real-time updates on their order status, from processing to delivery.
    - **Feedback System:** Customers have the ability to rate and provide feedback on their order and shipping experience.
    - **Personalized Recommendations:** Based on past purchases and browsing behavior, the system offers product recommendations to encourage repeat business.
- **Staff Interface:**
    - **Order Status Updates:** Staff can log in via a dedicated portal to update the status of orders (e.g., shipped, pending, canceled).
    - **Communication with Customers:** Updates made by staff are communicated back to customers in real time, ensuring transparency and timely notifications.

These features streamline daily operations and improve customer satisfaction by ensuring clear communication and efficient order management.

### 6. Analytical Module

The analytical module is designed to provide strategic insights through interactive dashboards and visualizations:

- **Dashboards and Reports:**
    - **Trend Analysis:** Line charts display order and SKU counts over time, helping to identify sales trends and the impact of marketing efforts.
    - **Order Status Monitoring:** Pie charts and bar charts reveal the distribution of order statuses, aiding in the assessment of fulfillment efficiency.
    - **Product and Geographic Insights:** Visualizations such as bar charts and word clouds offer insights into product performance and geographic sales distribution.
    - **Drill-Down Capabilities:** Users can interact with the dashboard (using combo boxes and interactive hover options) to filter data and drill down into specific aspects such as individual product performance or city-wise sales.
- **Interactivity and Export Options:**
    
    The dashboards allow users to apply filters dynamically, sort data in detailed tables, and export information to CSV for further analysis. This enhances both operational reporting and strategic decision-making.

### 7. Technical Aspects and Workflow

- **Execution:**
    - The operational module is launched using a main Python file (e.g., `main.py`), which orchestrates all customer and staff interactions.
    - The analytical module is run via a Jupyter Notebook (`GUIApp.ipynb`) that builds and displays the interactive dashboards.
- **ETL and Data Integration:**
    
    An ETL pipeline is used to seamlessly transfer data from operational tables to analytical fact and dimension tables. This ensures that the analytical views are always updated with the latest operational data.
    
- **Security and Data Governance:**
    
    Throughout the project, careful attention is paid to data security (e.g., password hashing) and maintaining data integrity through normalized schemas and robust ETL processes.

### 8. Future Scope

The project lays a strong foundation, and future enhancements could include:

- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Integrating live data streams for up-to-the-minute order and shipment updates.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Implementing machine learning models to forecast trends and optimize inventory management.
- **Mobile Access:** Developing mobile applications to provide remote access to both operational and analytical modules.
- **Enhanced UX and Security:** Continuously refining the user interface and implementing advanced security measures for even greater data protection.
- **Cloud Migration:** Moving the application to a cloud-based infrastructure for improved scalability and cost efficiency.
